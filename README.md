## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

At first sight, the grid looks pretty easy unless you actually got on with it. It is actually awesome to work around it.

### Continued development

I feel like I am constantly improving and going forward am gonna pay much attention to layout patterns, animation, etc.
